# Code Challenge: For Loops

## Instructions

2. Clone down this assignment to your `code-challenges' directory in AWS Cloud9.  
3. Code your solution using JavaScript in `index.js`. 
4. **Be sure to run and test your code throughly!**
5. By the end of Code Challenge, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
6. Using the browser, verify that your solution is in your remote repo on Github.

## Code Problems

1. Write a function named `countToFifty` that console.logs all the integers from 1 to 50. 

2. Write a function named `countFromOne` that takes in an integer argument, and console.logs all the integers from 1 up to the given integer. 

3. Write a function named `isPrime` that takes in an integer argument, and console.logs if the integer is a prime number.
Examples:
```
isPrime(17) // logs true
isPrime(5) // logs true
isPrime(22) // logs false
isPrime(1) // logs false
```
