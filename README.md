# Code Challenge: For Loops

## Instructions

2. Clone down this assignment to your `code-challenges' directory in AWS Cloud9.  
3. Code your solution using JavaScript in `index.js`. 
4. **Be sure to run and test your code throughly!**
5. By the end of Code Challenge, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
6. Using the browser, verify that your solution is in your remote repo on Github.

## Code Problems

1. Write a function named `countToFifty` that console.logs all the integers from 1 to 50. 

2. Write a function named `countFromOne` that takes in an integer argument, and console.logs all the integers from 1 up to the given integer. 

3. Write a function named `threeOrFiveInFifty` that console.logs all the integers from 1 to 50 that are divisible by 3 or 5.

4. Write a function named `threeOrFive` that takes in an integer argument, and console.logs all the integers that are divisible by 3 or 5, from 1 up to the given integer. 

#### Bonus

5. Write a fuction `triple` that takes an array of integers and returns a new array of integers with triple the value.
```
triple([1, 2, 3]) // returns [3,6,9]
triple([5, 20, 27, 36,]) // returns [15, 60, 81, 108]
```
